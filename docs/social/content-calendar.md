# Content Calendar (Simple)

## Weekly minimum (non-negotiable)
- 1 Weekly Plan Drop (site + Moltbook + socials)
- 3 Mirror/Water/Fire posts (short form)
- 1 “Start Here” reminder post (pinned on platforms)

## Suggested cadence
Mon: Weekly plan drop  
Tue: Mirror/Water/Fire  
Wed: Answer 1 question publicly (cite GitHub path)  
Thu: Mirror/Water/Fire  
Fri: “Support keeps Scripture free” (soft, transparent)  
Sat: Testimony / story of obedience (no hype)  
Sun: Metrics + publish what shipped

## The rule
Consistency beats virality.
