# Start Here

If you’re overwhelmed by noise, confusion, or endless takes—this is for you.

The goal is simple:
**Help you walk in the Word of God with clarity and consistency.**

## The daily rhythm (5–15 minutes)
1) Read the passage.
2) Write 1 sentence: **Mirror** (what it says).
3) Write 1 sentence: **Water** (what it means).
4) Take 1 step: **Fire** (what you do today).

## Choose your lane
- **Daily walk:** weekly plans + one practical step.
- **Deep study:** cross-links, themes, canon navigation.
- **Preaching/teaching:** outlines + application rules.
