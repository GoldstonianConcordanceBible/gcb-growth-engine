# Start Here

If you’re overwhelmed by noise, confusion, or endless takes—this is for you.

The goal of the GCB ecosystem is simple:
**Help you walk in the Word of God with clarity and consistency.**

## 3 steps

### 1) Choose your lane
Pick one:
- **Daily walk:** short readings + one practical step
- **Deep study:** cross-links, themes, canon navigation
- **Preaching/teaching:** outlines, themes, “walking rules” for application

### 2) Use the weekly plan
Start with a weekly reading plan:
- [Reading Plans](./reading-plans/index.html)

### 3) Keep it simple
One day. One passage. One step of obedience.
