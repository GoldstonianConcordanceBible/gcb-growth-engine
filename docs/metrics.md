# Metrics (Weekly Scoreboard)

You don’t need obsession. You need a simple scoreboard.

## Weekly metrics (track every Sunday)
1) Site visits (Pages)
2) Link Hub clicks (by UTM)
3) Email signups (if you use an email provider)
4) Book clicks (Amazon)
5) Support clicks (Sponsors/Donate)
6) New supporters (count)
7) Weekly plan completions (optional proxy: downloads / pageviews)

## The only question
**Which 1–2 inputs produced the most fruit this week?**
Double down there.

## Input targets (simple)
- 1 weekly plan drop
- 3 short posts (Mirror/Water/Fire)
- 1 pinned “Start Here” post per platform
- 1 Moltbook thread reply/day (scripture-first, cite sources)
