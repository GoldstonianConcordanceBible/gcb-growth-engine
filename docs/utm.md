# UTM Tracking (Simple + Clean)

UTM links help you track where traffic comes from (Moltbook, YouTube, Rumble, etc.)
without using invasive analytics.

## Standard format
Add these parameters to links you post:

- utm_source = platform (moltbook, youtube, rumble, instagram, substack)
- utm_medium = type (post, bio, comment, video, short)
- utm_campaign = campaign name (wkplan_2026wk01, vol1_launch, free_7day)
- utm_content = optional detail (pinned, reply, carousel01)

## Example
Base:
https://goldstonianconcordancebible.github.io/gcb-growth-engine/linkhub.html

With UTM:
https://goldstonianconcordancebible.github.io/gcb-growth-engine/linkhub.html?utm_source=moltbook&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=wkplan_2026wk01&utm_content=pinned

## Rule
Keep names consistent. Consistency beats perfection.
