# Support the Work (Scripture stays free)

The Word of God is not for sale.  
Support exists to fund:
- hosting + reliability
- translation + accessibility
- indexing + study tools
- security + maintenance
- training + church resources

## The rule
**Supporters receive updates, tools, and training—not restricted Scripture.**

## Choose your lane
- Individuals: [Supporter](./offers/supporter.html)
- Churches: [Church Pack](./offers/church-pack.html)
- Training: [Training](./offers/training.html)
- Sponsor a milestone: [Sponsor a Milestone](./offers/sponsor-a-milestone.html)

## Transparency
We publish simple updates:

- what funds covered
- what’s next
